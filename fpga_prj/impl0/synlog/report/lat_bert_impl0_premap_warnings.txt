@W: MT531 :"c:\git\lat_bert\rtl_sources\prbs7x1_chk.v":164:8:164:11|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 1 sequential elements including prbs7x1_chk0.bert_synched.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\git\lat_bert\rtl_sources\prbs7x1_gen.v":39:0:39:5|Found inferred clock prbs_loopback_top|clk_in which controls 79 sequential elements including prbs7x1_gen0.col_gen[6:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
